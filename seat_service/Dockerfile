### "cansim" is special value for using SeatAdjuster CAN simulator (even without vcan support in container)
ENV CAN=cansim
### if set to 1, forces running ecu-reset script on startup that does not work with cansim and also delays 3s the startup of can stup without actual Seat ECU
# ENV SC_RESET=0

### [vxcan] options
# By default, wait for can-forward.sh to move vxcan1 in container's namespace after container start
#ENV CAN=vxcan1
# If set, val_start.sh shall wait up to specified time (sec) for can interface to appear in the container.
